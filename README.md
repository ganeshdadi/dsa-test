Problem statement 1:
A threat intelligence corpus refers to a collection of data and information related to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. This corpus typically includes various types of data such as indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware signatures, attack patterns, vulnerability information, and other relevant data that can help organizations understand and mitigate cybersecurity risks

The goal of maintaining a threat intelligence corpus is to empower organizations to proactively defend against cyber threats. Security teams can use this information to enhance their detection capabilities, improve incident response processes, and implement effective security measures. Sharing threat intelligence within the cybersecurity community is also common, as it helps create a collaborative defense against evolving threats.

Classifying a threat intelligence corpus involves categorizing and organizing the data within the corpus based on different attributes. The goal is to make the information more manageable, searchable, and actionable for organizations and cybersecurity professionals.

In the realm of cybersecurity, the exponential growth of digital threats and the sheer volume of unstructured threat intelligence data present a formidable challenge for timely and accurate threat classification. Traditional methods of threat analysis often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of evolving cyber threats, leading to delayed responses and heightened security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the intricate nuances and context embedded in textual threat data demand a sophisticated approach for effective classification.

Current classification systems lack the agility required to adapt swiftly to emerging threats, and human analysts are burdened by the overwhelming volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed. Keyword-based approaches, while foundational, fall short in capturing the semantic richness and contextual intricacies of threat intelligence language. As a result, there is a pressing need for an advanced solution that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the classification and analysis of threat intelligence corpora.

The integration of Large Language Models, exemplified by models like GPT-3, offers the potential to automate and enhance threat detection and classification through natural language understanding. However, challenges such as model explainability, ethical considerations, and the need for tailored domain expertise must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of LLMs in cybersecurity operations.

This problem statement sets the stage for developing a solution that not only leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models but also addresses the specific challenges inherent in the realm of threat intelligence corpus classification. The goal is to create a system that empowers cybersecurity professionals with advanced tools to proactively identify and mitigate emerging threats in a timely and contextually informed manner.
