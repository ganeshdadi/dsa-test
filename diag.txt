Anomaly Detection Flow for Behavioral Fingerprint Authentication

This process ensures continuous monitoring and fraud prevention when a customer LLM interacts with the Bank LLM.

1️⃣ Fingerprint Registration (Onboarding Phase)

The Customer LLM is onboarded by capturing its behavioral fingerprint (parameters like temperature, top_k, top_p, response length, frequent tokens, etc.).

The fingerprint is stored in a vector database for future comparison.


2️⃣ Continuous Monitoring During Conversations

Every interaction is compared against the original fingerprint.

The system calculates similarity scores to detect deviations.

If an anomaly is detected, security mechanisms are triggered.

📌 Anomaly Score Calculation

The system calculates an Anomaly Score based on:

Semantic similarity drift (e.g., cosine similarity of embeddings)

Change in response length, token patterns

Response time deviations

Unexpected topic shifts



📌 Example Scenarios:

1. Minor Deviation: A slight variation in temperature → Just log the event.


2. Medium Risk: Different sentence structure than usual → Trigger Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).


3. High Risk: A drastic change in frequent tokens, sudden response slowdown → Block access & alert security.

📌 How This Helps Prevent LLM Fraud?

✅ Detects LLM Impersonation (Attackers trying to spoof a legitimate LLM)
✅ Stops prompt injection-based fraud (Tricking the Bank LLM into revealing unauthorized data)
✅ Prevents access token hijacking (Even if an attacker steals an API key, they can't mimic the real LLM’s behavior)
